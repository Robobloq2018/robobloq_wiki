![](/img/senor/c-6.png)**1.Overview**

　　The light sensor is developed based on the principle of photoelectric effect of semiconductors. It can be used to detect the intensity of ambient light. It is usually used to create interactive projects that produce special effects with changes in light intensity, such as smart desk lamp robots, chasing robots, etc.
